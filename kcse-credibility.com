ABSTRACT
We came up with idea to build an application software to reduce
 exam  cheating,  deforestation and  save time while taking national exams.The app uses radio wave technology to restrict candidates from corruption.
CHAPTER ONE:  INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background information 
There has been problems of exam cheating in Kenya for the past years since 1985 when the 8-4-4 system of education was introduced. This has caused many students going to school that  they are not intended to.It has promoted dishonesty thereby increasing corruption.


Statement of the problems
Exam cheating involves actual,intend,or attempted deception action in relation to any academic work of school.It has resulted in students cheating in the rest of their lives and having less professionals since students does not learn anything. 
STATEMENT OF ORIGINALITY 
We developed the idea from cases of exam incredibility in the national multiple questionnaire exams like in Kenya for example the  KCPE exam has had some cases of cheating for the past ten years.The papers for making the exams have been processed from trees which has promoted cutting down of trees thereby  reducing amount rainfall.It has also been time consuming to get results of national exams.
1.4	Objectives
To save time during national exams.
To conserve environment and reduce deforestation by the app.
To ease supervision and invigilation of exams.
To reduce exam cheating thereby eliminating mentality of corruption.






1.5.  RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
How can cases of exam incredibility be reduced  by use of technology that has changed our world to global village?
How can we control deforestation?
1.6	Hypotheses
The app will save our forests by reducing cutting of trees.
To enhance exam credibility.
1.5	Limitations 
We had limited time to develop the app proposal.


1.6	Assumptions
People will pay less for the national exams.
It will improve students ICT literacy.





1.7. MERITS AND DEMERITS 
1.7.1 MERITS 
It will reduce exam cheating.
It will ease supervision.
It will conserve forests.
Will enhance integrity. 
It will reduce corruption 



1.7.2	DEMERITS 
1.The mobile devices may be expensive
2.Cannot work without power.
CHAPTER 2: 	LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 	Analysis of  Previous research 
Cheating promotes corruption mentality and destroy lives of young people.According to UON respiratory  cheating in exams creates a culture of mistrust and devalues education.
2.3	Scientific Principle Used in Our Research.
Observation.As we observe  the cases of exam cheating each year.According to Star Kenya of 1st November 2018, CS Amina confirmed that more than 21 students had been arrested over exam malpractices.

2.4	Importance of Our Improvement.
It will help enhance exam credibility.
It will conserve environment.




CHAPTER THREE:   METHODOLOGY 

3.1.   Requirements 
Computer with access to internet.
App development platform.

     




3.2 PROCEDURES 

Connect the computer to the internet.
Choose app development platform for native app like Apache Cordova after creating a prototype of the app.
Code the app using JS, Java, html.
Then incorporate proposed functionalities.
Release the app to  a certain group of users for testing.Test it to usability,compatibility,security,interface checks, and authenticity.

3.3	DIAGRAMMATIC REPRESENTATION
Figure 3.2.1.  General diagram showing screens of the app.
















PRINCIPLE OF WORKING
Once installed the first screen opens with a sign up button.
The user inputs his  email ,full name, password and CAPTCHA like designed system to determine if the user is human.The sign up.The user will need to keep these details to use when logging in.
Then it will direct you to screen where it requires you to enter Name of your school,Class,Index number and school address.
Valid birth certificate number,    photos and fingerprint to be able to register for national exams.
It will take you to screen where it tells you days remaining for the exams.If the exam has reached it notify you to look on the device all time, ensures  you do not talk and before exam starts you put you fingerprints to detect if your are the original student. 

Checks you environment to ensure you are secure.Checks nobody is around you and if you take exam in school if checks face of those guys by use a cctv like camera.If you violate any of those rule your  exam will be  canceled and the app notifies exam managing body.The app is different from other exam management software in the following ways:No  leaving the app when the exam has started.
If the exam has started no quitting and cancelling.
No accessing another app in the same device if exam is going on.
No receiving call or messages in the exam period.
No accessing any other web,portal,homescreen,or teleconference and lock screen.
No logging out till the exam is over.
There will be  a camera that checks someone’s face and maintain it so that he/she does not  look any where besides iPhone’ app where the quiz is going.
It will also have to check the room where the candidate is doing the exam and ask him to place the camera pointing the room to ensure no sign language is used.If the students are in class it will notify the exam body.And if there are posters on the board the quiz will not come.It will also check the computer to check if the quiz has been retrieved and if so the candidate’s quiz will be deleted and not counted as a submission.
Should the candidate look anywhere and talk and also look anywhere besides app his/her assignment will be cancelled.
If the student has submitted the score will be either released immediately or submitted to the body managing exams.Though they will be graded automatically.
It will have a timer to ensure no one exceed.
The app will also be able to check the security of the area eg sub county and notify security agents as well as exam management  body using radio wave technology to take real time images.
I have not seen such an app currently that can control exam incredibility like this one.
There are existing quizzing apps but this one has modification to reduce exam cheating.The users will need to register before using the app.The app uses phone features like camera, geo-location, multimedia to record sounds,push notifications and calender.The  native app will be compatible with different computer systems to avail it to wider market.I will also need to have a control panel and a communication with the user to help monitor exam.I will ranked in search engine naturally.It can take four months to develop.The quiz will be kept secretly and released on the eve of exam day and may also be set on that day to avoid exposure to exams for revision. It uses radio wave technology to take real time images when the area IP address is is embedded in a browser.


 



3.4.2	Principle of working 


PRINCIPLE OF WORKING


The software works by detecting  faces,sound,geo location, fingerprint and area someone is.It detects these using sound meter, satellite signals , facial recognition technology and fingerprint authentication.

3.4.3	PARAMETERS
Independent Variable:  Type of computer used.

Dependent Variable: Reducing exam cheating and conservation of environment.


SCHAPTER 4: 	DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
4.1	TABULATION

Table 4.1.1.Relationship between data collected over two weeks on usage of seatbelts and the percentage of reduced accidents and the rate of overloading.

4.2	GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION
(
Figure 4.2.2.A graph showing the Percentage of reduced cases of exam cheating.
4.3	Data Interpretation
 From  the data analyzed we found out that  exam incredibility has reduced by 40%.
4.4      STATISTICS 
According to   nation.co.ke    a total of 2709 candidates cheated in the 2015 KCPE exam which was an increase from 1702 in 2014.The cheating represented 0.29 percent of the candidates who sat for their examination and the cases were found  in 111 out of 25127 examination centers representing 0.44 percent of the total number of examination centers.




CHAPTER FIVE:  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
5.1. CONCLUSION 
 The project will reduce exam cheating and conserve environment.The app will promote integrity thereby reducing the mentality of corruption.
5.2 RECOMMENDATIONS 
   We would like to invite other researchers to improve on our project into practical skills and improve it , provide funding for development and marketing,optimization and to create user oriented design of the   integrity kcpe app.We also suggest that researchers use biometric technology to restrict cheating.
